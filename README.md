# Histogram Matching-assisted and 3D SLIC supervoxel segmentation pipeline

## Overview
This repository hosts a PyQt-based graphical user interface designed to streamline the analysis of microscopic images. The GUI facilitates the importation of images, application of segmentation algorithms, and visualization of results, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and user-friendliness of cell analysis techniques and counting.

Note: This repository is currently private due to confidentiality reasons.

## Features
1. Image Import- Easily import microscopic images into the application.
2. Cell Counting - Count the number of cells in spheroids from 3D confocal image stacks.
3. Visualization: Visualize segmented images and analysis results directly within the GUI.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Designed with PyQt to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
